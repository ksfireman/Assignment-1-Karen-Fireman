What am I hoping to learn from this class.

Here's what I am hoping to learn in this course (combined somewhat with the beginning of Dr Jones' course)

I'd like to be able to program comfortably in Python (mostly a goal I guess for DR Jones' class.)  I think the Pandas book will help greatly, already has, b/c there are so many "similar but yet different ways to do each thing and the subtleties of what is or isn't allowed often trip me up, eventhough the logic of it I understand.

Jamey, this may not be what you're looking for, but I am hoping to learn, anything and everything you have to teach.  I'm hoping to get a strong mastery of it, so that I can do it again and again, long after the class is over.  I love analyzing data.

I'd like to start doing analysis projects and putting them up -- maybe on my website - or a link to my github, creating summaries (I dont love the word blog) about them, but right now I feel a bit of "all thumbs" and timid about doing it, or even selecting something.  I'm not sure why, but that's something I would like to get from this class.  I think you do this sort of thing all the time.  It would be a great accomplishment, to get the momentum to be doing this...Note, thinking of myself as "timid" doesn't suit me, so I hope this course helps me do more, "publish" stuff, and keep writing.
As I like to say, "This isn't the dress rehearsal, this is my real life."  I want to make sure I am doing the things that drive me, that I like, that I'm good at and that feel rewarding.
 
 I hope that helps, although I imagine you were expecting me to say, I want ot learn about containers, and ___, and ___ - but I don't even know what they are to tell you I want to learn about them - so just teach me, and hopefully I will "rise to the occasion."
  
  Thank you,
